# WebView video player

This repository contains the necessary dependencies to use a video player in the webview of a React Native application. The video player can be used to play videos within the app without leaving the native experience.

Here is the list of dependencies needed for the video player to work:
- node_modules/video.js/dist/video-js.min.css
- node_modules/video.js/dist/video.min.js
- node_modules/videojs-contrib-ads/dist/videojs-contrib-ads.css
- node_modules/videojs-contrib-ads/dist/videojs.ads.min.js
- node_modules/videojs-ima/dist/videojs.ima.css
- node_modules/videojs-ima/dist/videojs.ima.min.js

These dependencies are listed in the gitignore file so that they are included in the repository without having to track the entire node_modules folder.
